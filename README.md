# Artifact creation recipes

Scripts for creating a party group, party, tenure, and spatial unit
in Open Index Protocol using Flo's RPC and Desoto's llama services.

## Currently compatible with oip-041

The scripts uses entity publish templates that are compatible with OIP's version `oip-041` instead of `oip042`. The Alexandria
team plans to upgrade `oipdaemon` to be compatible with `oip-042` in the near future (April 2018). When the upgrade
occurs, these examples will have to change the message templates to be compatible with `oip042`. Monitor the [Alexandria
chat](https://chat.alexandria.io) to know when this occurs.
